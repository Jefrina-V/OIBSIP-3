In this Temperature Converter program, the HTML part builds the structure of the page. The <!DOCTYPE html> declares the document type, <html lang="en"> sets the language, and the <head> contains the title, character encoding, and CSS link. Inside the <body>, a <div class="container"> holds all components: a heading <h2> for the title, an <input type="number"> for entering temperatures, a <select> dropdown with <option> tags to choose between Fahrenheit to Celsius or Celsius to Fahrenheit, a <button> which triggers the conversion when clicked, and a <div id="result"> to display the output. The CSS file styles the components, giving the body a clean font and background, while the container is centered with padding, rounded corners, and a box shadow. Inputs, buttons, and selects are styled for size and spacing, and the button changes color on hover. The JavaScript defines the convertTemperature() function, which collects user input using document.getElementById, converts it to a number with parseFloat, and checks for validity using isNaN. If valid, it applies the correct formula—(F − 32) × 5/9 for Fahrenheit to Celsius or (C × 9/5) + 32 for Celsius to Fahrenheit—rounds the result to two decimal places using .toFixed(2), and displays it in the result <div>. This integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript makes a functional and neatly styled calculator.
